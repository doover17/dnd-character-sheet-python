## üõ† **Technical Specifications**

### **Core Classes**
- `Equipment` - Base equipment class with weight, value, description
- `Weapon` - Weapons with damage, properties, and combat calculations  
- `Armor` - Armor with AC calculations and restrictions
- `Inventory` - Complete inventory management with slots and currency
- `MagicItem` - Magic items with charges and special properties

### **Key Features**
- **Automatic AC calculation** from equipped armor and shield

- **Magic item attunement** with 3-item limit

### **Integration Points**
```python
# Character automatically gets inventory
character = Character()
character.inventory.add_item(weapon)
character.inventory.equip_item(item)

# AC updates automatically
ac = character.inventory.calculate_ac(dex_modifier)
character.vitals.armor_class = ac
```
