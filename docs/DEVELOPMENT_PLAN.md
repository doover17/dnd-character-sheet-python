## Communication Guidelines

1. **Daily Standups**: 15-minute check-ins via Slack/Teams
2. **Code Reviews**: All PRs require review from senior developer
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant .md files with any architectural changes
4. **Testing**: All new features must include unit tests
5. **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with descriptive names

## Getting Started

1. Read your team's specific task documentation
2. Set up development environment (see SETUP.md)
3. Review existing codebase and architecture
4. Start with the highest priority tasks marked as "Phase 1"
5. Create feature branch for your work
6. Submit PR when ready for review
